# Orangey-Bits

A color theme for Emacs with Smashing Orangey Bits! It was inspired by my ancient emacs theme tangerine.
which itself was inspired by old amber CRT, DEC VT terminals I used in the 80s.

### Forked from Creamsody

It's the Orangey fork of Creamsody, inspired by the Amber CRTs of my youth, and that theme I made 10 years ago, that isn't on melpa.

Smashing Orangey-bits is almost certainly some kind of trademarked phrase.  I do enjoy jaffa cakes, so send me some.
